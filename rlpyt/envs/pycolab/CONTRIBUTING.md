# Contributing guidelines

## How to become a contributor and submit your own code

### Contributor License Agreements

Before we can accept your patches to pycolab, we have to jump a couple of legal
hurdles.

Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement
(CLA).

*   If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you
    own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an [individual
    CLA](http://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html).
*   If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work,
    then you'll need to sign a [corporate
    CLA](http://code.google.com/legal/corporate-cla-v1.0.html).

Follow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA and
instructions for how to sign and return it. Once we receive it, we'll be able to
accept your pull requests.

***NOTE***: Only original source code from you and other people that have signed
the CLA can be accepted into the main repository.

### Contributing code

We welcome useful contributions to pycolab!

Because pycolab aims to be a stable platform for describing various
reinforcement learning tasks, API changes will need to be pretty important to be
accepted into this "official" distribution. For some changes, the best option
may be to fork pycolab and apply modifications to the fork.

New components are desirable, particularly new Sprites and Drapes (and protocols
to support them). (A laser beam Drape would be especially handy...)

Internal speedups that don't make it harder to use or modify pycolab would be
great, too!
