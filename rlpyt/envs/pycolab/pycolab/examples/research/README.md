# Environments for RL research

This subdirectory contains pycolab games that have been created to explore real
research questions in reinforcement learning and related fields. Developed in
the frenzy of scientific investigation, they may not be the tidiest
demonstrations of how to use pycolab (or Python for that matter, or perhaps even
computers in general). Additionally, the system requirements for the games
(required libraries, etc.) may differ from the base requirements for pycolab
itself. Still, they may help illustrate what you can build. Contents include:

  * `[lp-rnn]`: Challenging memory tasks for an upcoming arXiv paper release
    (more details pending).
  * `[box_world]`: Perceptually simple but combinatorially complex environment that requires abstract relational reasoning and planning.
  * *your code here?*
