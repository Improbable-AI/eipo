  """The pycolab game engine.

  Every pycolab game is an instance of `Engine`. These games all have certain
  things in common:

  * They're grid-based! â–¦
  * Games proceed in discrete steps: the player calls the `play` method with
      their chosen action, and the `Engine` updates the board in response, which
      then becomes the observation returned to the player.
  * By default, observations are a single 2-D numpy array "board" with dtype
      `uint8`, or, alternatively, a collection of binary masks (see
      `Observation` in `rendering.py`).
  * Values are painted onto the board by instances of `Backdrop`, `Sprite`,
      and `Drape`, which are described in detail in `things.py`. (Now would be
      a fine time to go read more about them. Go ahead--it'll be fun!)
  * Additionally, it is expected that your game logic will be arranged within
      these objects somehow.
  * `Backdrop`, `Sprite`, and `Drape` instances can communicate with each other
      and affect global game state (reward, termination, etc.) through the
      game's `Plot` object. ("Plot" as in "thickens", not as in "Cartesian".)
  * (Now is NOT the best time to read more about the `Plot`; for the time being,
      just remember that it's a global blackboard. :-)

  At each game iteration, the `Engine` instance consults the `Backdrop` and each
  `Sprite` and `Drape` to determine how to update the board. These
  consultations, which happen in a specified, fixed order, are also when the
  game logic within those objects chooses how to react to the things they see on
  the board, the actions from the player(s), and the information stored in the
  game's `Plot`. Once all the updates have been applied, the new board is shown
  to the user, and the `Engine` awaits the next action.

  In the simplest arrangement, the `Engine` collects updates from the `Backdrop`
  and from all `Sprite`s and `Drape`s, then repaints the board all at once.
  This means that all of these objects will base their decision on the state of
  the board as it was when the user chose an action. More complicated
  arrangements are possible. By placing `Sprite`s and `Drape`s in separate
  "update groups", you can force the `Engine` to repaint the board after only
  some of the updates have been collected. For example, if update group 0
  contains

      [sprite_A, drape_B, sprite_C]

  and update group 1 contains

      [drape_D, sprite_E, sprite_F]

  then the `Backdrop`, `sprite_A`, `drape_B`, and `sprite_C` will see the board
  as it was last seen by the user, while `drape_D`, `sprite_E`, and `sprite_F`
  will see the board after the updates from the first four are applied. This
  may simplify your game logic.

  No matter how things are arranged into update groups, the user will only see
  the board after the updates from *all* `Sprite`s, `Drape`s, and the `Backdrop`
  have been applied.

  From here, it's probably best to read the documentation for `Plot` (it's okay
  now!) and then the docstring for the `Engine` constructor.
  """

  def __init__(self, rows, cols, occlusion_in_layers=True):
    """Construct a new pycolab game engine.

    Builds a new pycolab game engine, ready to be populated with a `Backdrop`,
    `Sprite`s, and `Drape`s (see `things.py`). Once set up, an `Engine` will
    manage the rendering and logic of a game for one episode.  (For new
    episodes, make a new `Engine`).

    A newly-constructed `Engine` makes for a really boring game: there is
    nothing to draw on the game board and no game logic. In fact, the `Engine`
    will refuse to work at all without a `Backdrop`.

    Here's what you need to do: after construction, supply the engine with
    a `Backdrop` object to paint the background of the game board (things like
    walls and such), and then `Sprite` and `Drape` objects to move around on top
    of it (see `things.py` for details). These objects can view the game board
    and communicate with each other (usually via a `Plot` object), and the game
    logic is implemented in their interactions.

    Here is an example of a simple game setting up a new `Engine`:

        engine = pycolab.Engine(rows=24, cols=80)
        engine.set_backdrop('#+|-* ', my_game.Mansion, time='1 AM', moon='full')
        engine.add_sprite('C', (22, 77), my_game.Ghost, name='Claudius')
        engine.add_sprite('E', (19, 61), my_game.Ghost, name='Ebenezer')
        engine.add_sprite('I', (11, 48), my_game.Ghost, name='Ichabod')
        engine.add_sprite('!', (23, 18), my_game.Player, hit_points=99)
        engine.add_drape('~', my_game.MistsAndVapours, breeze=1)

        first_obs, first_reward, first_discount = engine.its_showtime()

    The order in which `Sprite` and `Drape` objects are added to the `Engine`
    determines (partially; read on) the order in which they will be consulted
    for game board updates: in this case, after the `Backdrop`, which is always
    consulted first, it's Claudius, Ebenezer, Ichabod, the player, and then a
    `Drape` that paints spooky mists. This ordering cannot change once it is
    set.

    The order of addition is also the initial back-to-front "z-order": the order
    in which the updates are painted onto the board. Although `Backdrop` updates
    are always painted first, the rest of the layers can change their z-order at
    any point in the game (by registering a request with the `Plot` object).
    This may be useful if you ever want Ichabod to float in front of the spooky
    mists. Z-order can also be changed at game set-up time via the `set_z_order`
    method.

    Once the `Backdrop` and all of the `Sprite`s and `Drape`s are ready,
    call `its_showtime()` to start the game. This method "locks" the engine
    (i.e. no new `Sprite`s or `Drape`s can be added) and starts the episode,
    returning the first observation.

    Here is a more elaborate game setting up its `Engine`:

        engine = pycolab.Engine(rows=7, cols=7)
        engine.set_backdrop(sokoban.Warehouse.CHARACTERS, sokoban.Warehouse)

        engine.update_group('2. Player')
        engine.add_sprite('P', (5, 3), sokoban.Player)

        engine.update_group('1. Boxes')
        engine.add_sprite('1', (3, 2), sokoban.Box)
        engine.add_sprite('2', (5, 4), sokoban.Box)
        engine.add_sprite('3', (2, 5), sokoban.Box)

        engine.update_group('3. Judge')
        engine.add_drape('J', sokoban.Judge)

        first_obs, first_reward, first_discount = engine.its_showtime()

    The `Engine`'s order for consulting `Sprite`s and `Drape`s for updates is
    determined first by the sort order of the update group name, then by order
    of addition. Thus, in this Sokoban implementation, the `Engine` will first
    consult box sprites 1, 2, and 3 for board updates, then the player sprite,
    and finally the "Judge".  (The Judge in this game happens to be an invisible
    `Drape` whose `update` method contains the logic that determines whether
    the player has won the game.)

    Nevertheless, the consultation order is different from the initial z-order,
    which starts at the backdrop and proceeds directly in the order in which the
    `Sprite`s and `Drape`s were `add_*`ed. (This structure could allow a player
    to crawl under a box in this Sokoban---or perhaps a box to crush a player!)

    This game has given a name to all of its update groups, which is a good idea
    whenever you have more than one. The default update group is named `''`
    (the empty string).

    And, for one last hyper-technical detail: the `Backdrop` can be thought of
    as belonging to the very first update group, and will always be the first
    `Engine` entity to be consulted for an update in that group. If it is
    desired that all `Sprite`s and `Drape`s be in a separate update group from
    the backdrop, the best way to accomplish this is probably to establish an
    update group that precedes all of your game's real `Sprite`s and `Drape`s,
    and to populate it with an invisible sprite that never does anything.

    Args:
      rows: Height of the game board.
      cols: Width of the game board.
      occlusion_in_layers: If `True` (the default), game entities or `Backdrop`
          characters that occupy the same position on the game board will be
          rendered into the `layers` member of `rendering.Observation`s with
          "occlusion": only the entity that appears latest in the game's Z-order
          will have its `layers` entry at that position set to `True`. If
          `False`, all entities and `Backdrop` characters at that position will
          have `True` in their `layers` entries there.

          This flag does not change the rendering of the "flat" `board` member
          of `Observation`, which always paints game entities on top of each
          other as dictated by the Z-order.

          **NOTE: This flag also determines the occlusion behavior in `layers`
          arguments to all game entities' `update` methods; see docstrings in
          [things.py] for details.**

  prone (what if 'j' isn't a valid value for the Backdrop to use?).

  A `Palette` object (which you can give a very short name, like `p`) is
  programmed with all of the valid characters for your Backdrop. Those that are
  valid Python variable names become attributes of the object, whose access
  yields the corresponding ASCII ordinal value (e.g. `p.j == 106`). Characters
  that are not legal Python names, like `#`, can be converted through lookup
  notation (e.g. `p['#'] == 35`). However, any character that was NOT programmed
  into the `Palette` object yields an `AttributeError` or and `IndexError`
  respectively.

  Finally, this class also supports a wide range of aliases for characters that
  are not valid variable names. There is a decent chance that the name you give
  to a symbolic character is there; for example, `p.hash == p['#'] == 35`. If
  it's not there, consider adding it...
